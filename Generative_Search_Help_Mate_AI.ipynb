(2) The policy will be for life insurance only. No disability or other benefits will be included. (3) The policy will be on one of the forms, other than term insurance, then issued by The Principal to persons in the risk class to which the Member belongs on the individual policy's effective date. (4) Premium will be based on the Member's age and the standard rate of The Principal for the policy form to be issued. b. Purchase Qualification A Member will qualify for individual purchase if insurance under this Group Policy terminates and: (1) the Member's total Life Insurance, or any portion of it, terminates because he or she ends Active Work or ceases to be in a class eligible for insurance; or (2) after the Member has been continuously insured under this Group Policy for at least five years, his or her total Member Life Insurance terminates because this Group Policy terminates or is amended to exclude the Member's insurance class; or (3) the Member's Coverage During Disability as described in PART IV, Section A, ceases because Total Disability ends and he or she does not return to Active Work within 31 days; or (4) the Member's Accelerated Benefits Premium Waiver Period as described in PART IV, Section A, ceases and he or she does not qualify for Coverage During Disability . c. Application/Effective Date Notice of the individual purchase right must be given to the Member by the Policyholder before insurance under this Group Policy terminates, or as soon as reasonably possible thereafter.

Members who are eligible to become insured are to be reported during the month prior to or during the month that coverage becomes effective. b. Members whose coverage has terminated are to be reported within a month of the date coverage terminated. c. Changes in Member insurance class are to be reported within a month of the date that the change in insurance class took place. If a Member is added or a present Member's insurance is increased or terminated on other than the first of an Insurance Month, premium for that Member will be adjusted and applied as if the change were to take place on the first of the next following Insurance Month.

(2) The policy will be for life insurance only. No disability or other benefits will be included. (3) The policy will be on one of the forms, other than term insurance, then issued by The Principal to persons in the risk class to which the Member belongs on the individual policy's effective date. (4) Premium will be based on the Member's age and the standard rate of The Principal for the policy form to be issued. b. Purchase Qualification A Member will qualify for individual purchase if insurance under this Group Policy terminates and: (1) the Member's total Life Insurance, or any portion of it, terminates because he or she ends Active Work or ceases to be in a class eligible for insurance; or (2) after the Member has been continuously insured under this Group Policy for at least five years, his or her total Member Life Insurance terminates because this Group Policy terminates or is amended to exclude the Member's insurance class; or (3) the Member's Coverage During Disability as described in PART IV, Section A, ceases because Total Disability ends and he or she does not return to Active Work within 31 days; or (4) the Member's Accelerated Benefits Premium Waiver Period as described in PART IV, Section A, ceases and he or she does not qualify for Coverage During Disability . c. Application/Effective Date Notice of the individual purchase right must be given to the Member by the Policyholder before insurance under this Group Policy terminates, or as soon as reasonably possible thereafter. A Member must apply for individual purchase and the first premium for the individual policy must be paid to The Principal within 31 days after the date Member Life Insurance or Coverage During Disability terminates under this Group Policy.

Members who are eligible to become insured are to be reported during the month prior to or during the month that coverage becomes effective. b. Members whose coverage has terminated are to be reported within a month of the date coverage terminated. c.

Effective Date for Initial Contributory Insurance When Proof of Good Health is not Required If a Member is to contribute a part of premium, insurance must be requested in a form provided by The Principal. Unless Proof of Good Health is required (see b. above and e. below), the requested insurance will be in force on: (1) the date the Member is eligible, if the request is made on or before that date; or (2) the date of the Member's request, if the request is made within 31 days after the date the Member is eligible.
